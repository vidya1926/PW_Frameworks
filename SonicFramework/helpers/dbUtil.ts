It provides an executeQuery method to execute SQL queries and return the results.
The class ensures proper connection handling and error management. */

It reads the database host, user, database name, password, and port from the JSON file.

waitForConnections: true ensures that if all connections are in use, new requests will wait rather than failing immediately.

connectionLimit: 10 sets the maximum number of connections.

queueLimit: 0 allows an unlimited number of queries to be queued. */

If the query execution fails, an error is logged and rethrown.
